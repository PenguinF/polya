# Pólya.hs

Journey into [Pólya's enumeration theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_enumeration_theorem) using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

It's my first Haskell project in a decade so don't expect any fancy code or good use of libraries. Feel free to tidy things up if you like.

Features a polynomial type bound on variables of some Eq or Ord type, and scalars of any [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring). For nerd points made a genuine [monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) out of it.

To play around with the code:

- Install the [Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
- Clone this repository, for example to `C:\Dev\polya`
- Start WinGHCi
- On the command line, type: `:load "C:/Dev/polya/main.hs"`
