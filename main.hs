-- Example: graphs on 1 or more points.

-- Usage:
-- -- Get the number of generated permutation functions which map an edge to another, for graphs with 4 vertices:
-- > length $ enumPermuteGraphEdgeMappings $ undirectedGraph 0 3
-- 24
-- -- Now find out where the edge between vertices 0 and 1 ends up when the third (index 2) permutation function is applied to it:
-- > ((enumPermuteGraphEdgeMappings (undirectedGraph 0 3)) !! 2) (GraphEdge (GraphVertex 0) (GraphVertex 1))
-- GraphEdge (GraphVertex 1) (GraphVertex 2)
-- -- Show the Cayley table of the PÃ³lya group for graphs with 4 vertices:
-- > cayleyTable $ graphPolyaGroup 4
